# This is where it begins!
In this repository, we can share and collaborate on the assessment, excluding any Word documents which can be easily modified using the pre-existing share features.

If our final project requires a *code repository*, then a seperate repo will be made, attatched to the same project. This allows for us to pick and choose what to submit for our final assessment.

## Due Dates
Project Proposal: 21st November 2024

Final Project: 8th May 2025
